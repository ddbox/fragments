# 
## docker container running a jobsub server
build: ./buildme.sh (args)  where args can be docker build flag like --no-cache
run: ./runme.sh

NB: copy hostcert/hostkey from from /etc/grid-security to certs/ directory.
I understand this really should be done with volumes, I am still learning docker
